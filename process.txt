"#Intructions to process a customer record"
Prompt user for "customer name"
Prompt user for "purchase amount"
Prompt user for "tax code"
Assign "tax code" to a percent amount (could be a pre-defined database, if so this would be an import statement at the beginning)
If "tax code" is not 0% then multiply by corresponding percent and save that value to "tax"
Add "tax" to purchase amount to give and save as "Total amount due"
print "customer name" your total amount due is: $"Total amount due"
