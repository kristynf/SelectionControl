Test Data:

This could be tested with an Income Tax Scenerio as well.
Set up different income brackets. Ask name of constituents. Ask income. Assign a tax bracket based on income from a simple database.
Perform math. Print out the tax due.

Additionally, this could be done for an internet transaction determined by state. Customer enters their state which determines how much tax they are charged. 
The tax percent is calculated by multiplying it to the purchase price and then adding the result to the original purchase price. Then the total is displayed to 
the customer.
