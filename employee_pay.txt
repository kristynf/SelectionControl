Test Case 

Another possible case this might work with alerting managers when someone is always getting overtime when the company policy is no overtime. I know that was the
policy at my last company. This could also be used in the reverse, if they are not working all their hours. 

In the first case, this would just take looking for any employee over 35 hours, while processing the payroll, flagging them for a report to the manager. 
In the second case, this would take looking for any employee working under 35 hours (assuming this is their FTE)
